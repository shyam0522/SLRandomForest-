# SLRandomForest-

PROJECT TITLE:
  
  CLASSIFY THE RANDOM_FOREST ALGORITHM USING SKITLEARN CLASSIFIER "RANDOMFORESTCLASSIFIER"FOR "iris.csv".AND PREDICT THE DATA HOW MANY SPECIES ARE INTERCONNECTED WITH AND THE 'DECISION TREE NODE'.

TASK:

TASK-1:
  IMPORT THE RANDOM_FOREST CLASSIFIER BY USING 'sklearn.ensemble'LIBRARY.

TASK-2:
  LOAD YOUR DATA USING SEABORN GRAPHICS LIBRARY AS ARGUMENT "load_iris()"

TASK-3:
  PREPROCESS THE DATA USING SKILEARN GRAPHICS LIBRARY.

TASK-4:
  SELECT THE MODEL USING "MODEL_SELECTION" FROM 'sns'AS A SEABORN SKLEARN AS A SKITLEARN MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY.

TASK-5:
  LOAD THE "iris.csv" DATASET FOR DATA AS INPUT VARIABLE AN TARGET AS A OUPUT FUNCTIONAL VARIABLE.

TASK-6:
  PICK THE TRAIN AND TEST DATA USING ARGUMENTED LIBRARY 'train_test_split'.

TASK-7:
  SELECT THE ESTIMATORS AS A nth DECISION TREE.

TASK-8:
  USE A RANDOM_FOREST CLASSIFIER AND FIT YOUR MODEL.

TASK-9:
  FIND OUT YOUR MODEL ACCURACY

CONCLUSION:

▶MY MODEL AS APPROACH '1.00'ACCURACY,WHICH IS LIES BETWEEN IN THE RANGE OF '0 to 1'

▶HENCE,IT IS SHOWS THAT RANDOM_FOREST DECISION MODEL SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT
